# calculator
This is my <b>first web development project</b>, a dynamic and visually appealing <b>Web Calculator</b> designed with creativity and interactivity in mind. It features a <b>smooth intro animation</b> where my name briefly pops up and fades out, adding a modern personal touch. Users can switch between <b>three custom themes</b> — Light, Dark, and Pink — to enhance their experience. Each button includes <b>click sound effects</b> for responsive feedback. While it performs only <b>basic arithmetic operations</b> (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), the calculator delivers a clean, user-friendly interface. It is also <b>responsive</b> for tablets and large screens, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience across devices.
